This assignment utilizes sed, bash, and some other command-line utilities to create a program for formatting C code. 
My program takes a source code file as input and apploes the following:
• No more than one space between tokens.
• No trailing whitespace after a line.
• Binary operators should always surrounded by a single space on either side (including assignment and Boolean). Only the following operators must be accounted for: +, -, *, /, =, ==, <=, >=, <, >.
• Conditions should not have whitespace immediately inside of the parentheses.
• The program should not modify spaces which are leading, expanded tabs.
• Comments should be left alone. You may assume comments (single- and multi-line) will not appear on lines with source code.
